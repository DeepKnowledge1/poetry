# Poetry - Python Dependency Management and Packaging Made Easy

Poetry stands out as a great alternative to Anaconda/Miniconda. It has several benefits:

- **Easier Dependency Management**: Poetry manages dependencies, ensuring the right versions are installed and preventing conflicts.
- **Separate Environments**: Poetry sets up isolated virtual environments, keeping development setups clean and reproducible.
- **Packaging Included**: Poetry simplifies packaging and publishing Python projects.
- **Consistent Setup**: By using the `pyproject.toml` file, Poetry ensures all project contributors have the same environment, reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
- **Better Security**: Poetry's lock file (`poetry.lock`) provides a detailed view of dependencies, making it easier to handle security concerns.

## How to Setup Python, PyEnv, and Poetry on Windows

### Prerequisite
Run the following command in PowerShell as admin to avoid any issues:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

---

### Step 1: Install PyEnv
PyEnv is a Python version management tool. Use the following commands to install it:

```powershell
# Download the install-pyenv-win script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/master/pyenv-win/install-pyenv-win.ps1" -OutFile "./installpyenvwin.ps1"

# Run the script with execution policy bypassed
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "./installpyenvwin.ps1"
```

---

### Step 2: Install Python Versions
Once PyEnv is installed, install the desired Python version. For example:

```powershell
pyenv install 3.9.0
```

To see installed versions:
```powershell
pyenv versions
```

Set a global Python version:
```powershell
pyenv global 3.9.0
```

---

### Step 3: Install Poetry
Poetry is a dependency management tool for Python projects. Install it with:

```powershell
pip install poetry
```

---

## Working with Poetry

### Install Dependencies
If your project uses Poetry (indicated by a `pyproject.toml` file), install dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install
```

---

### Activate the Virtual Environment
Poetry automatically creates virtual environments for your projects. Activate the environment with:

```bash
poetry shell
```

---

### Initialize a New Package
Navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
poetry init
```

---

### Add Packages
1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Ensure the `pyproject.toml` file is in the directory.

2. **Add a Package**:
   ```bash
   poetry add requests
   ```

3. **Specify Package Version (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   poetry add requests@2.26.0
   ```

4. **Add Multiple Packages**:
   ```bash
   poetry add requests numpy matplotlib
   ```

---

### Add Development Dependencies
1. **Add a Dev Dependency**:
   ```bash
   poetry add dev pytest
   ```

2. **Specify Package Version (Optional)**:
   ```bash
   poetry add dev pytest@6.2.4
   ```

3. **Add Multiple Dev Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry add dev pytest flake8 black
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

---

### Remove Packages or Dev Dependencies
1. **Remove a Package**:
   ```bash
   poetry remove requests
   ```

2. **Remove a Dev Dependency**:
   ```bash
   poetry remove pytest
   ```

---

### Update Packages
1. **Update Regular Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry update
   ```

2. **Update Dev Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   poetry update dev
   ```
